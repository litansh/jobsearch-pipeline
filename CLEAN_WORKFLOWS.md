# 🗂️ Clean Workflow Organization

## 📋 **Current Workflow Cleanup:**

### **✅ Keep These 4 Workflows:**

1. **`daily.yml`** - Daily scheduled job search
   - Runs at 05:30 UTC daily
   - Complete pipeline with state persistence

2. **`search-commands.yml`** - Telegram `/search` commands
   - Triggered by `/search` in Telegram
   - Same as daily but on-demand

3. **`sync-job-state.yml`** - Button click sync
   - Triggered when clicking Telegram buttons
   - Syncs Applied/Ignored state to GitHub

4. **`tailor.yml`** - Cover letter generation
   - Manual trigger with job ID
   - Generates tailored cover letters

### **🔧 Issue Found - Score Threshold Too High:**

**Problem**: Jobs scored 0.52-0.56 but threshold is 0.78
**Result**: No jobs sent because none meet threshold

**Current scores:**
- Platform Director @ Pango: 0.5641
- Head of DevOps @ Vicarius: 0.5342  
- Head of DevOps @ Transmit: 0.5329
- Director @ Zenity: 0.5324

**Threshold**: 0.78 (too high!)

## 🎯 **Recommended Fixes:**

### **1. Lower Score Threshold:**
```yaml
# In both daily.yml and search-commands.yml
echo "SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.50" >> $GITHUB_ENV  # Instead of 0.78
```

### **2. Or Test with Lower Threshold:**
```bash
# Test locally with lower threshold
SCORE_THRESHOLD=0.50 make digest
```

## 📊 **Expected Results After Fix:**
- ✅ `/search` command will find and send 5-8 jobs
- ✅ Daily workflow will send more job opportunities  
- ✅ Better coverage of relevant positions

The workflows are clean now - the issue is just the score threshold being too restrictive!
