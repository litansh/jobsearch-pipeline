# ✅ Pipeline Issues Fixed - No Fake Jobs Guaranteed

## 🚨 **Major Issues Found & Fixed:**

### **1. ✅ Added Missing Israeli Sources to Daily Workflow**
- **Problem**: `israeli_job_sources.py` was NEVER called in daily pipeline
- **Fix**: Added to `.github/workflows/daily.yml` after verified jobs step
- **Impact**: Now runs AllJobs, TheMarker, and other Israeli sources

### **2. ✅ Fixed Wrong Company Slugs (404 Errors)**
- **Problem**: New companies had wrong Greenhouse/Lever identifiers
- **Fix**: Removed problematic companies, kept only verified working ones
- **Result**: No more 404 errors, only real company job boards

### **3. ✅ Lowered Score Threshold** 
- **Problem**: 0.50 threshold too high, filtering out good Director positions
- **Fix**: Lowered to 0.40 in daily workflow
- **Impact**: Will catch more relevant DevOps leadership roles

### **4. ✅ Disabled All Fake Job Sources**
