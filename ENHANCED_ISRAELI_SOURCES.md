## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### **Current Integration**
The `israeli_job_sources.py` script is already implemented but **not running in the daily workflow**. 

### **Manual Testing**
```bash
# Test the enhanced sources locally
python test_enhanced_sources.py

# Run Israeli sources directly  
python scripts/run_israeli_sources.py

# Run full pipeline step
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python scripts/israeli_job_sources.py
```

### **To Integrate into Daily Workflow**
The GitHub Actions workflow would need to add this step:
```yaml
- name: Search Israeli job sources
  run: |
    export PYTHONPATH=$GITHUB_WORKSPACE
    python scripts/run_israeli_sources.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Impact

### **Before Enhancement**
- ~24 companies in Greenhouse/Lever
- Limited Israeli startup coverage
- Missing top employers like Nvidia, Google Israel

### **After Enhancement**  
- **50+ companies** across all major platforms
- **Top 2025 startups** with high growth potential
- **Best places to work** in Israeli tech
- **Multiple job sources**: Greenhouse, Lever, Comeet, SmartRecruiters, Career Pages

### **Potential Results**
- **2-3x more job opportunities** from Israeli companies
- **Higher quality positions** from top-rated employers
- **Earlier access** to roles at hot startups
- **Better coverage** of the Israeli DevOps leadership market

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Test locally**: Run `python test_enhanced_sources.py`
2. **Verify sources**: Check if new companies are returning jobs
3. **Monitor results**: See if more high-quality positions appear
4. **Integration**: The Israeli sources can be manually triggered or added to workflow

The enhanced configuration preserves all your position requirements while dramatically expanding the search to Israel's top companies and hottest startups! ðŸŽ¯
