# 🔘 Telegram Buttons Not Working - Fix Instructions

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**

Your Telegram buttons are **not working** because there's **no callback handler running**. The buttons send callback queries to Telegram, but nothing is listening for them.

When you click "✅ Mark Applied" or "❌ Not Relevant":
- ❌ No processing message appears
- ❌ Nothing happens to the job
- ❌ No confirmation messages

## 🛠️ **Solution: Start Callback Handling**

You need to run **one of these options** to handle button clicks:

### **Option 1: Polling Mode (Recommended for Testing)**

Run this command to start listening for button clicks:

```bash
cd /Users/litan.shamir/repos/jobsearch-pipeline
nohup make webhook-poll > telegram_bot.log 2>&1 &
```

This will:
- ✅ Listen for button clicks in the background
- ✅ Show processing messages
- ✅ Update job state when you click buttons
- ✅ Send confirmation messages

### **Option 2: Test Polling (Foreground)**

For testing, run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/litan.shamir/repos/jobsearch-pipeline
make webhook-poll
```

You'll see output like:
```
Starting polling for updates...
[INFO] Processing callback: apply_abc123
[JOB_STATE] Marked as applied: Head of DevOps @ Company
```

### **Option 3: Webhook Mode (Advanced)**

For production, you can set up a webhook server, but polling is simpler for now.

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix:**

1. **Start polling**:
   ```bash
   make webhook-poll
   ```

2. **Send a test digest** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   make digest
   ```

3. **Click buttons in Telegram** - you should now see:
   - 🔄 "Processing..." message immediately
   - ✅ Job marked as applied with confirmation
   - 📝 Follow-up message explaining the action

## 📊 **What You Should See:**

### **Before (Broken):**
- Click button → Nothing happens
- No processing message
- No job state changes

### **After (Working):**
- Click "✅ Mark Applied" → 
  - 🔄 "Processing..." appears
  - Message updates to show "APPLIED"
  - ✅ Confirmation: "Great choice! This job won't appear in future digests..."
- Click "❌ Not Relevant" →
  - 🔄 "Processing..." appears  
  - Message updates to show "NOT RELEVANT"
  - ❌ Confirmation: "Got it! I'll use this feedback to improve future job matches..."

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

**If buttons still don't work:**

1. **Check if polling is running**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep telegram_bot
   ```

2. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f telegram_bot.log
   ```

3. **Test bot connection**:
   ```bash
   make test-telegram
   ```

**If you get "404 Not Found" errors:**
- Your Telegram bot token might be incorrect
- Check your `.env` file has the right `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`

## 🚀 **Permanent Solution:**

To have button handling always running, add this to your startup scripts or run it after each reboot:

```bash
cd /Users/litan.shamir/repos/jobsearch-pipeline
nohup make webhook-poll > telegram_bot.log 2>&1 &
```

The buttons will work perfectly once the callback handler is running! 🎯
